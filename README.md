# Pizzaria
CIS4280 Programming Assignment 1

[Title Screen](../PizzariaScreenshots/TitleScreen.png)
This was a project towards the beginning of my Mobile Application Programming class at Cal Poly Pomona. We used Android Studio and coded in Java. It's a simple app that allows the user to choose the pizza size via a spinner and choose toppings via checkboxes. The user is then taken to another screen where they can input their information (name, address, phone, email) and click submit. A receipt is then displayed on the screen with user info and order total. The main goal of the project was to save state changes when the screen is rotated as well as carry the data between views.
